## Description 
Euromillions is a very simple ReactJS app that a random number for you to play the Euromillions lottery. It will return you 5 numbers from 01 to 50 and two "stars" numbers from 01 to 12. 

## Motivation
This project was created by myself with the intention of learning at React. I wanted to create my own small project, get my hands dirty and not just follow an online tutorial. 

#### Project Goals: 
1) Learn the basics of React
2) Get used to the React ecosystem
3) Learn how to properly use React Classes.
 
Althought nowadays React Hooks are broadly use, React Classes are not deprecated and you will encounter in not so old code. Thats why it is important to learn how they work.  

#### About the UX/UI Design
The goal of this project was not to develop a great UI/UX design, just to focus on coding. But as a designer myself, I needed at least a minimun viable UX to pleased my eyes while coding. It is a really minimal design I made by myself.
